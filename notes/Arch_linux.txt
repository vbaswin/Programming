check the devices connected to your system 
lsblk -f
mount a file system to a folder in /(root) or any other folder
mount /dev/-dev_no(sda1 or sdb1) /directory path

>>==>> to permenantly mount we have to edit /etc/fstab file and include the lines we want
UUID=08264f2e-4e9e-403d-bbd0-72e62301e07c /media/mydisk (dir path) ext4 (partition type) defaults,noatime 0 2

to mount an android devie install the simple-mtpfs package by downloading the git

sudo pacman -S libtmtp
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/simple-mtpfs.git
cd simple-mtpfs
makepkg -si

run simple-mtpfs -l to list all the available android devices
note its number and run the command
simple-mtpfs --device <number here 1> <mount point here phone> ********** This is possible only in the home directory not root like other storage partitions so mount it in 

umount -l /home/vbaswin/realme_narzo_30_5G
>> if not mounting


/home/vbaswin/phone or anything if you are in vbaswin then just type the directory name

>> to unmount unmount <directory path>
to format a drive first install using 
sudo pacman -S dosfstools

then sudo fdisk -l to list all the available devices and then
to format in fat32 format use 
sudo mkfs.vfat -I /dev/<device name eg: sda or sda1>
use -I to override 

sudo mkfs.ntfs /dev/sdb1 --> format in ntfs format

For example, the following command will format my USB drive in FAT32 format and set label name for my USB drive as "sk".

$ sudo mkfs.vfat /dev/sdb1 -n sk

if no audio install alsa mixer
and type alsamixer in terminal then f6 and select intel hda pch which will display volume bars
if anything is mute (MM) change it to 00

change to left handed mouse
xinput list - to display the available connected devices and remember the device id no eg: id=11

to set to left handed
xinput set-button-map id 3 2 1
eg xinput set-button-map 11 3 2 1
>>==>> put this in bspwmrc file for permanent effect

to set to right handed

    Ctrl-d Moves cursor & screen down ½ page
    Ctrl-b Moves screen up one page, cursor to last line

if the file is not staging changes that means it is either having another separate git file 
just delete it and everything is back to normal

:y% - yank or copy all the contents of the file 

:s/<word to search>/<word to replace>/  - to search and replace a word
:s/<word>/<replace word>/g - replace all occurences in current line
:%s/<word>/<replace>/g - repace all in the entire file **** % *** this indicates a range from first

to substitute all occurrences of ‘foo’ to ‘bar’ in all lines starting from line 3 to line 10 
:3,10s/foo/bar/g

The dot . character indicates the current line and $ - the dollar sign the last line. To substitute ‘foo’ in all lines starting from the current line to the last one:

:.,$s/foo/bar/

For example to substitute each ‘foo’ with ‘bar’ starting from the current line and the four next lines

:.,+4s/foo/bar/g

The substitute command looks for the pattern as a string, not a whole word. If, for example, you were searching for “gnu”, the search find matches where “gnu” is embedded in larger words, such as “cygnus” or “magnum”.

To search for a whole word, type \< to mark the beginning of a word, enter the search pattern, type \> to mark the end of a word:

For example, to search for the word “foo” you would use \<foo\>:

:s/\<foo\>/bar/

>> ctrl + l to clear the search and redraw the screen 

H - move cursor to top of screen
L - move cursor to bottom of screen
