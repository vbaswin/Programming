/* 
STORAGE CLASS

4 types
    ~> automatic or local
    ~> external  or global
    ~> static
    ~> register

    local  -> variables declared inside a block eg in the main fn 
             or in the for loog it is declared etc
    global -> varibles that are declared outside all functions :
            accessible from any function inside the program
    Register -> The register keyword is used to declare register
                 variables.
                Register variables were supposed to be faster than
                local variables.
                The register storage class is used to deﬁne local 
                variables that should be stored in a register 
                instead of RAM.
