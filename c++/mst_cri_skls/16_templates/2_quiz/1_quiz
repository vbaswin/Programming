/*
   Templates thus helps in building generic code-
   Generic code are codes written in terms of types-to-be-specified-later
   ie; same code works for different data types

   Compiler does type checking before template expansion. 
   source code contains functions/class, but compiled code may contain
   mulitple copies of same function/class

   helps to avoid code duplication
   
   Examples of function templates are sort(), max(), min()
   except isupper - mainly for characters
