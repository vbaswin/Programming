/* 
Problem #4: Flatten 3D Array

Read 3 numbers: DEPTH, ROWS, COLS the dimensions of 3D array
Then read integer either 1 (convert 3D to 1D) or 2 (1D to 3D)
If input was 1, then read 3 integers d, r, c then convert to position in 1D array
If input was 2, then read 1 integer position, then convert to 3D array position
Try to generalize if we have e.g. 6D array

Input                â‡’ Outputs
3 4 5   1   1 0 0       20
3 4 5   2   20          1 0 0 
3 4 5   1   1 1 1       26 
3 4 5   1   2 3 2       57
3 4 5   1   2 0 0       40 
3 4 5   2   59          2 3 4
